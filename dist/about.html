        <p>
          Ever since I was a kid I’ve always had an interest in technology. Just
          looking at an IC or a motherboard amused me, to think of “who is the
          mastermind who designed what seems to be a microscopic city where
          everything is placed in the right order” I had to know how it worked,
          and so it started out as just a hobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve been coding since 2018 in different languages such as C, C++,
          Java, HTML and CSS, just because it was fun to know. However it wasn’t
          until January 2020 when I decided to start my own path into becoming a
          full stack web developer, I knew I had a lot to learn at the time, but
          the more I learned the more I realised how much I don’t know, and the
          desire to know more grew with every line of code I wrote. Today I use
          JavaScript, node.js, and react on a daily basis, but I know I have a
          long way to go, a lot of problems to solve, and a lot of ideas to
          execute. as Jeff Delaney from fireship.io said: “ideas are cheap,
          execution is everything”. My name is Abd al Qader, and I’m a self
          taught web developer.
